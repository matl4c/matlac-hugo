# matlac-hugo
This is a custom hugo theme made for my personal website [matl.ac](https://matl.ac). It is extremely minimal and designed for what I want in a simple blog. With that in mind, the contents of this repository may change over time to fit my needs. If I ever completely overhaul my site to the point where it is not connected to this theme, I will make a separate repository in an attempt to leave this theme as is.

I do not care if people use or modify this theme for themselves, but if you do I would love to hear about it! My up to date contact information can be found on my website.

Credits:
- [hugo-bearblog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog)
  - My theme is directly derived from this one. The `exampleSite` directory is the same example site used by bearblog. If you are looking for a similar minimal theme, bearblog is one you should check out as my theme would not exist without it.
- [lugo](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/lugo)
  - The footer contents came from Luke Smith's minimal hugo theme `lugo`. He also has some very good content on hugo if you are looking to learn more about building your own theme from scratch.
- [Team Fortress 2](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Template:Paint_Can)
  - All of the colors on my site besides the native hugo code block coloring came from TF2's paint cans. I like the colors of the game and I thought coloring my site in this way would be funny :)

  - The ascii art header for my site came from the Calvin S font on this ascii art generator.
